				<h2> Mrs. Sheehan </h2>
			Mrs. Sheehan has been coaching the team for 6 years, as long as it has been in existence. As a matter of fact, she created the team for her sons who were attending S.T.E.M.M. in 6th and 8th grade at the time of the Tech Turtles' creation. Mrs. Sheehan handles the logistics, planning, and finances for the team, along with overseeing that the necessary roles on the team are fulfilled by its members.</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h2> Mr. Jo </h2>
			Mr. Jo is Mrs. Sheehan's husband, who has been working with the team for just as long as she. Mr. Jo brings a lot of experience to the team, as he has been working as an aircraft mechanic for 24 years. This means that he mentors the engineering and build team, guiding them toward smarter and more efficient methods of achieving the team's goals. </div>
