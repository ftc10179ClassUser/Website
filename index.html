				<p>	We are FTC Team 10179, the Tech Turtles. As an FTC Team, our main goal is to promote FIRST. One of the key methods we use to do this is Gracious Professionalism. Gracious Professionalism is the idea that we should treat all people with respect and kindness, regardless of if they are the opposition in a professional way, e.g. letting a rival team borrow a part they need that we have.<br/>	However, as we are a robotics team, we do more than just think about the philosophical meaning of Gracious Professionalism: we build robots! Every year, we build and program a robot to complete certain tasks that gain us points in that year's competition. For example, this year's competition is Skystone, a competition based around building a tower of interlocking "stones". In addition to the creation of the robot, we also thoroughly document our work in the engineering book (or "E-book") for that year. As a matter of fact, the work we do in the E-book is the major factor in our ranking at competition, making it imperative that we do this well.
