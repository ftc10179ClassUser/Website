				<h2> FTC Open House - Outreach </h2>
				<p>At our FTC Open House, we schedule a date to present to those interested in joining the major aspects of our team at Okaloosa S.T.E.M.M. Academy. For example, we tell them about functions such as E-book, programming, and building of our team.</p>

				<h2> Thrift Sale - Fundraising </h2>
				<p>June 7 - 8, 2019, we held a thrift sale at O.S.A. to raise funds for parts for our robot. We sold off donations from parents and coaches, unneeded items such as gently used lunchboxes and blankets at a reduced price.</p>
